This package is based on [nova-tabs](https://github.com/eminiarts/nova-tabs) to make it more like resource navigation tabs instead of just tabs for relations.

No changes needed regarding to `nova-tabs` package.

The way of displaying panels and relations is the same like for normal resource. 

Keep in mind that you can use `->withToolbar()` on `Tabs` instance if you want to display toolbar 
(resource edit button and resource actions) in case that `Tabs` instance is the first field 
in your resource fields definition.
